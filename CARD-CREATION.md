## Making Custom Cards

Making your own cards is easy! The card creator uses Google Sheets as its data source. Here's how to get started:

1. Create a Google Sheet with the card information you'd like. Here's an [example card data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MVZ2hqihag6QvbRgBGafOi_NbNhZ1TL2a1DH_ojG__o/edit#gid=987926921), we recommend copying it to your Google account and working from there.
2. Publish your sheet to the web in Sheets. File -> Publish to the Web. Make sure it's set to "Link", "Entire Document" and "Web Page", then hit publish.
3. Copy the publish link.
4. Open the card creator website, select Source -> Custom, and paste your publish link.
5. Voila! Your cards should now be imported; you can select whichever theme you'd like, review the cards for appearance and accuracy, then print with `Ctrl + P` / `Command + P`
